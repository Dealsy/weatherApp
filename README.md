# Getting Started with the weather App

## Running the app.

You will need to create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following:

`REACT_APP_API_KEY=<YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY_HERE>`

You can get your free API key from here: [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## DEMO

## Hosting

You may host this site on any platform that supports static sites. I used Netlify for this project.

When placing the site on a hosting platform, you will need to add your weather API_KEY as an environment variable.

## Additional Information

This site requires you to allow location access in order to get the weather for your current location.
